3rd Year Project: Exploring Novel CNN Architectures for Maximizing the Capabilities of the Scamp-5 Vision Chip

The Scamp-5 vision chip offers a unique advantage by enabling real-time computation immediately following data acquisition, effectively minimizing overall processing latency. In this project, our primary focus centers on the investigation of diverse architectural designs capable of harnessing the computational prowess of the Scamp-5 chip for the rapid execution of image recognition tasks at exceptionally high frame rates.
