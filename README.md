# DeepLearningVisionChip
3rd Year Project: Invest new CNN architectures to enhance the potential of a vision chip
The Scamp-5 vision chip permits computation directly after data acquisition, hence reducing the entire processing time.
Here, we will inverstigate the different architectures which could use this chip power of comnputation to process 
image recognition tasks at a very high frame rate.
