**Project Highlight**: Leveraging the **Scamp-5 vision chip** to perform real-time computations immediately post-data acquisition, significantly reducing processing latency.

## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

The Scamp-5 vision chip stands out in its ability to enable on-the-spot computations right after data acquisition, ensuring minimized delays in processing. Our project dives deep into this capability, aiming to:

- Investigate diverse architectural designs.
- Harness the full computational potential of the Scamp-5.
- Achieve rapid image recognition tasks.
- Maintain exceptionally high frame rates.

Join us as we push the boundaries of what's possible with the Scamp-5 vision chip and convolutional neural networks!
